# Cards

This is my second Angular project made with Typescript and Bulma. It's simple cards.\
This time my main study theme were decorators, two-way binding(Input), CSS scope and host element seletor.
I've learned how to make reusable components and how does Angular create components in general, how is going communication between parent and child and how does ngFor directive work.\
For now it's very raw, but I'm going to improve it, make it more interesting and beautiful.\
You can try it [here](https://cards-tawny-nine.vercel.app/).
